LEARNING GOALS:

Design and architect features across a frontend
Communicate and collaborate in a technical environment
Integrate JavaScript and an external API
Debug issues in small- to medium-sized projects
Build and iterate on a project 

For this project, I built a Single Page Application (SPA).
The  frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and communicate with a json-server.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
The app has a HTML, CSS & JS frontend that accesses data from a db.json file using json-server.The  db.json return a collection of objects with each object having at least 3 attributes. All interactions between the client and the db.json is handled asynchronously and uses JSON as the communication format. 

The entire app runs on a single page. There are  NO redirects or reloads. In other words, your project contains a single HTML file.

I used at least 3 distinct event listenersLinks to an external site. (3 events of different types) that enable interactivity. 

This project implements at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc).
